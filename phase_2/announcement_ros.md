# ROS Test announcement

## Timetable

ROS Test will take place on **Tuesday, 15th of July 2025**.

Starting list is based on the Connectivity Test as we've received no complaints about the final time slots. If you need to **swap** your time slot with another Team - please coordinate that on the Community Forum and let us know.

We only allocated **15 minutes for each team**, so please show up at least 5 minutes earlier and be ready to start at the exact time.

Each hour is divided into 4 slots - 3 for teams and 1 for the organizers. There's also a 1 hour break after first 2 hours. This should allow us to keep the schedule somewhat flexible, in case of any issues, but please be mindful that mishaps may happen.

## Communication

Test will take place on Zoom, URL will be provided roughly a day before the Test.

There's a dedicated email address for **live** communication during the tests: **erc@husarion.com**.
Please use it **only** during the Tests, and also CC **teams@roverchallenge.eu** each time you'll be using it so we have all the data in one place.

Keep in mind that **teams@** will **not** be monitored turing live events.

## Husarnet Beta

ROS Test and any further events will be held on **Husarnet Beta** platform. This will mean separate Husarnet Accounts and so on. Please keep an eye on the official Husarnet announcements in the following weeks for exact Beta dates.

## On-site computing

Expect your on-site computing connect/login data to be sent to you roughly a week before the Test. This may require some additional Husarnet setup on your side so please be ready for that.
