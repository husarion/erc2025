# Connectivity Test announcement

## Timetable

Connectivity Test will take place on **Tuesday, 3rd June 2025**.

Up to this point we've received no any special requests (neither the lack of participation notices, nor any time preferences), so the list from the Qualification Results still stands.

We've tried to assign time slots in such a way that all the Teams start during their day time as much as possible. If you need to **swap** your time slot with another Team - please coordinate that on the Community Forum and let us know. Also - **please double-check your local time** - we may have made some mistakes.

As this test is rather simple, we only allocated **15 minutes for each team**, so please be ready to start at the exact time, but please show up at least 5 minutes earlier to grab your spot in the queue.

Each hour is divided into 4 slots - 3 for teams and 1 for the organizers. There's also a 1 hour break after first 2 hours. This should allow us to keep the schedule somewhat flexible, in case of any issues, but please be mindful that mishaps may happen.

## Communication

Test will take place on Zoom, URL will be provided on Monday.

We've also created a dedicated email address for **live** communication during the tests: **erc@husarion.com**. Please use it **only** during the Tests, and also CC **teams@roverchallenge.eu** each time you'll be using it so we have all the data in one place. Keep in mind that **teams@** will **not** be monitored turing live events.

## Organization

### Husarnet Beta

Payload Test and any further events will be held on **Husarnet Beta** platform. This will mean separate Husarnet Accounts and so on. Please keep an eye on the official Husarnet announcements in the following weeks for exact Beta dates.

### Initial on-site computing spec

Technical Handbook has been updated with the initial on-site computing specification. This is still subject to change, but we wanted to give you a rough idea of what to expect.
