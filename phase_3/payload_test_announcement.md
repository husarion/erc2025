# Payload Test Announcement

Payload Test will take place on **Tuesday, 29th of July 2025**.

## Communication

Test will take place on Zoom, URL will be provided roughly a day before the Test.

There's a dedicated email address for **live** communication during the tests: **erc@husarion.com**.
Please use it **only** during the Tests, and also CC **teams@roverchallenge.eu** each time you'll be using it so we have all the data in one place.

Keep in mind that **teams@** will **not** be monitored turing live events.

## Gist of this Test

This test has a slightly different format than all of the previous ones. This time **you** are the one who will be providing a plan of what will happen - we will be mostly observing. The ideal workflow would be something like this:
1. Our checklist (are all of you in the correct Zoom room, robot interface connected, DDS was restarted, etc.)
2. [Time Slot starts now]
3. Your short presentation of the development so far
4. Your presentation of the plan for the Test
5. [10 minute time limit for presentations]
6. Test execution
7. Free time (for things like recording data if you need to do so)

Have in mind that we intend you to test a **reasonably sized subsystem** - meaning things like the navigation stack, machine vision, etc. This will allow you for small mishaps that will have a small impact on the overall score. If you choose to test something **really small** (like a single sensor-communication) we will limit the amount of points that you will be able to score for the test category - as we want these scores to be at least somehow comparable.

> [!NOTICE]
> Ideally all the communication issues that you've faced during the ROS Test should be resolved by the Payload Test (using the setup available between the Tests).
